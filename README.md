# KSP-Beamed-Power-Standalone-mod
This is a mod (plugin) that adds Beamed Power code to the stock game (KSP)
There are three part modules the core mod adds that you can use: WirelessSource, WirelessReceiver, and WirelessReflector.
At the moment, you'll have to add these part modules to any part you want to use for beamed power. Instructions for how to do that
are on the ksp forums page, as well as in the install folder's README file.

Localization files are available to download from the localization folder above. You need to download and copy the files in there to the localisation folder in your GameData/BeamedPowerStandalone/Localization.
