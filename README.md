# KSP-Beamed-Power-Standalone-mod
This is a mod (plugin) that adds Beamed Power code to the stock game (KSP)
There are three part modules this adds that you can use: WirelessSource, WirelessReceiverDirectional, and WirelessReceiver
At the moment, you'll have to add these part modules to any part you want to use for beamed power. Instructions for how to do that
are on the ksp forums page, as well as in the install folder's README file.
